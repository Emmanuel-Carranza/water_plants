# When to water my plants ?

Everytime I think of watering my plants, I weigh them by hand and make a decision.
This time, the precise weight measurements and plant conditions will be manually
collected daily for future analysis. The goal being to determine the most accurate
time to water them based on their weight declining due to evaporation and the
roots being fed.
